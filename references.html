          <q>Working with Cornelia is a real bonus on a project. She brings her energy, motivation and know-how which help clients get involved in phases of the project that are often abstract to them. She turns UX into a game for the clients and the projects into a sucess. In a year working by her side, I also have learnt a lot myself.</q>
